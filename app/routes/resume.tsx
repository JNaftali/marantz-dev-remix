      <h2>Who am I</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name's Josh. I'm a fullstack web developer, bootcamp grad, and folk dancer.</p>
      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I do a lot of different things! I'm most comfortable on the back side of the frontend -
        business logic, fetching data, state management, component architecture and (where
        applicable) wrangling types. I've done a fair amount of work with HTML and CSS, focused on
        structure and accessibility rather than presentation. I've also written server-side code -
        API endpoints, templates, even database queries and migrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy working with people! After finishing Dev Bootcamp, I worked to mentor the
        students that came after me. I love discussing and learning about programming with other
        people. Now that Dev Bootcamp has shut down I volunteer at{' '}
        <Link href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</Link> to scratch a similar itch. I really enjoy
        pair programming and working with colleagues.
      </p>
      <h2>What technologies I've used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and many of the DOM APIs</li>
        <li>
          Client side Typescript (and Javascript). This includes frameworks like React and Angular
          as well as state management tools like Redux and NGRX and much more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server side Typescript (and Javascript) via Node, including various ways of rendering
          client side frameworks on the server
        </li>
        <li>Python including the Django web framework</li>
        <li>Creating reusable environments with Docker</li>
        <li>And more! Ruby, SVG, Lua and Bash scripting</li>
        <li>
          And RegExp. Somehow everything I do ends up using regular expressions and I don't mind in
          the least.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          My role is mostly writing client and server side Typescript (interactive components,
          client side routing, etc.). I also write a fair amount of Python code to configure the{' '}

              Their website was a social media site for authors to share their works and receive

              My first task at Thelab was to rewite some of the more interactive bits in typescript,
              React and Redux. These included the "edit profile" form, the custom comments, and the
              e-reader.

            <li>
              Both sites draw content from a shared Django backend. The frontends were Angular
              Universal apps - server-rendered in Node and transformed into SPAs (single page apps)
              on the client side. Caching via AWS Cloudfront kept users from having to wait for
              pages to render on the server. We used{' '}
              <Link href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify's</Link> Graphql APIs to provide
              e-commerce functionality and NGRX for structured global state.

              This site still uses the Django backend Thelab is familiar with, but the frontend is

              also provides caching). We are leveraging{' '}
