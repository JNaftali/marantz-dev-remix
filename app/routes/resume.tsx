        <li>I've been working there since the end of 2017</li>
        <li>
          My role is mostly writing client and server side Typescript (interactive components,
          client side routing issues, etc). I also write a fair amount of Python code to configure
          the <Link href="https://wagtail.io">Wagtail CMS</Link> we use (and to make miscellaneous
          API enpoints).

              Their website was a social media site for authors to share their works and receive
              feedback from readers. The most popular works were chosen by Macmillian to be
              published.

              Initially built in Django templates with JQuery, my first task at thelab was to rewite
              some of the more dynamic bits in React. These included the "edit profile" form, the
              custom comments, and the ereader.

              We built (and now maintain) 2 websites for them:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <Link href="https://www.devacurl.com">https://www.devacurl.com</Link> - A consumer

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Both sites draw content from a shared Django backend. The frontends were Angular
              universal apps - server rendered in Node and transformed into Single Page Apps on the
              client side. Caching via AWS Cloudfront kept users from having to wait for pages to
              render on the server. We used Shopify's Graphql APIs to provide e-commerce
              functionality.

            <li>
              This site still uses the Django backend we're familiar with, but the frontend is
              written in Next.js (a server-rendered React framework) and hosted on Vercel (which
              also provides caching). We decided to leverage Saleor this time for e-commerce
